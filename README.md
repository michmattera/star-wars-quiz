## Introduction
This is a quiz build for all **Star Wars** fan.
It tests all star wars fan for knowledge on how much they know the Star Wars world.
 
The main goal of the user is answering correctly at least half of the total of questions to win the quiz.

The questions are divided in:

This is a fun and interactive quiz created for the second of five Milestone projects required to complete the Diploma in Software development (eCommerce Applications) program at The Code Institute.
The main requirements of this project are to use all the technologies learned so far, **HTML5** , **CSS3** AND **JAVASCRIPT**. 

## UX
### Ideal Player Demographic
The ideal player for this quiz is:
* New player
* Old player


### Player Goals

#### New Player

This quiz is for users that would like to have fun and get their knowledge tested on **star wars**.
1. As a new player I would like to get visually stimulated by Star wars symbols at first impact.
2. As a new player I would like to easily navigate the main page and find all features that remind me of a game such as : 
    - Leaderboard
    - Instructions on how to play
    - Inserting username to save
    - Sound
    - Automated questions and answers

2. As an older player I would like to be able to change my username and play again.

## Development Planes

To build an interactive front-end site, that the user can interact with and get back data.
For this purpose, I chose an interactive quiz, set in the: **Star wars** world.
The website presents data and information based on the main topic.

Development planes were made in the following order:
- Strategy
- Scope
- Structure
- Skeleton


### Strategy
Used to determine business goals and user needs.

Business goals:
- Get the user to play.
- Get the user to insert a username.
- Get the user to save the score and try different levels of the quiz.
- Get the player to try both sides of the game quiz.
- Stimulate the user with audio, visual effect, and images.

User needs were determined based on different target audiences: 

- **Roles:**
    - New player
    - Old player

- **Demographic:**
    - No minimum age
    - From all over the world

- **Psychographic:**
    - Star wars fan
    - Quiz lovers

### Scope

The scope plane, based on the goals established on the strategy plane, identified the following two categories.
- Content Requirements:
    - The user will be looking for:
        - Information about star wars
        - Different modalities to play
        - Instructions on how to play
- Functionality Requirements:
    - The user will be able to:
        - Be able to insert username and save the score
        - Play again

### Structure

The structure was then created like a game-based interface with all the features on just one page.
 Clicking different icons and buttons will show the user different information and presents him with different choices.

The page was then structured into 3 different sections:
    - The heading = That included the main title, and a container with main icons for game
    - Center = That includes the rapresentation of two buttons where the user clicks to decide which game and questions to answer
    - End = footer with copyright information and developer social media


### Skeleton

Wireframes were made to organize and make the skeleton of the website. The wireframes were created using the free platform[Uizard](https://app.uizard.io/prototypes)).
