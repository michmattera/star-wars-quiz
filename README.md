## Development Planes

To build an interactive front-end site , that the user can interact with and get back datas.
For this purpose I chose an interactive quiz , set in the : **Star wars** world.
All website presents data and information based on main topic.

Development planes were made in the following order:
- Strategy
- Scope
- Structure
- Skeleton


### Strategy
Used to determine business goals and user needs.

Business goals:
- Get the user to play.
- Get the user to insert unsername.
- Get the user to save score and try different levels of quiz.
- Get the player to try both side of game quiz.
- Stimulate user with audio, visual effect and images.

User needs were determined based on different target audiences: 

- **Roles:**
    - New player
    - Old player

- **Demographic:**
    - No minimum age
    - From all over the world

- **Psychographic:**
    - Star wars fan
    - Quiz lovers

### Scope

The scope plane, based on the goals established on the strategy plane, identified the following two categories.
- Content Requirements:
    - The user will be looking for:
        - Information about star wars
        - Different modalities to play
        - Instructions on how to play
- Functionality Requirements:
    - The user will be able to:
        - Be able to insert username and save score .
        - Play again

### Structure

The structure was then created like a game-based interface with all the features on just one page.
 Clicking different icons and buttons will show the user different information and presents him with different choice.

The page was then structured in 3 different sections:
    - The heading = With the main title, and a container with main icons for game
    - Center = with the rapresentation of two buttons where the user click to decide which game and questions to answer
    - End = footer with copyright information and developer social media


### Skeleton

Wireframes were made to organize and make the skeleton of the website. The wireframes were created using app.uizard .
